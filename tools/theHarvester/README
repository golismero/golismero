What is this?
-------------

theHarvester is a tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers). 

Is a really simple tool, but very effective for the early stages of a penetration test or just to know the visibility of your company in the Internet.

The actual sources are:

-pgp: pgp key server - pgp.rediris.es 

-linkedin: google search engine, specific search for Linkedin users

-shodan: Shodan Computer search engine, will search for ports and banner of the discovered hosts  (http://www.shodanhq.com/)

-vhost: Bing virtual hosts search

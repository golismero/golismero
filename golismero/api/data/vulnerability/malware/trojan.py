    Trojan Horse Detected.

    A trojan horse was detected. Trojan horses are malware that pretends to be
    legitimate software (and sometimes is) but in addition to that it contains
    a backdoor that allows an attacker to access the system subprepticiously.
    This is an indication of an earlier compromise by an unknown agent.
